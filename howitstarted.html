                <h2 class="mb-3">One encounter changed it all</h2>

                <p><img src="images/img_7.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid"></p>

                <p>It was a cold night in Allston, a neighborhood just 10 minutes east of Boston with some fantastic Korean restaurants. It was mid-October 2018, and my roommates and I had just finished having dinner and were heading back to the train. One of my roommates covered the bill, and the other 2 of us just Venmo'd him our share of the damage. This Venmo payment ended up being very, very important. </p>
                <p>On our walk to the B-line train, we had a brief chat with a man experiencing homelessness. After a few minutes of speaking, he asked if we had any spare change to help buy a new winter jacket. My roommates and I all pulled our wallets out and rifled through them, but none of us had any cash on us. We apologized, and then the man said something that would go on to have profound impact:  </p>
                <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">"That's alright, it happens all the time."</h2>
                <p>This got the cogs spinning. I'd suddenly realized, in hearing those words, that in a world becoming more and more cashless, people who often depend entirely on cash donations are becoming increasingly marginalized. I instantly thought back to the restaurant, on how easy it was to pay my roommate back through my phone but how difficult it was to support this stranger.</p>
                <p>After a day of thinking about it, I realized debit cards could be the solution to this. If there was a way I could send money directly from my phone or computer to individuals facing homelessness that they could spend instantly, that'd solve the cashless-society problem. There was a little more to it though. I quickly realized that if we're already innovating the donation process, why not add a layer of transparency to it? If cards had micro-level controls where they are blocked from purchasing alcohol or using ATMs, donors can have the confidence of knowing money won't be misspent whilst recipients still have a dignifying amount of financial freedom.   </p>
                <p>
                  <img src="images/image_10.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                  <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">How did I turn a powerful idea into reality?</h2>
                </p>
                <p>I believe that there is no greater motivator than irreversible action. I had a good feeling about the GiveCard idea (the name came immediately), and I needed to commit to it. So the night after I'd come up with the idea for GiveCard, I went online and incorporated it as a nonprofit. It cost half of the money I had in my bank account, so I knew I'd really commit to this.</p>
                <p>From here, I had an idea, and I had a company, and so I needed a team. Building the GiveCard family is a story so intricate it deserves its own blog, but by random conversations and amazing coincidences, within 1 week there were 9 people on our team, and now a year in we've grown this team to 11.</p>
                <p>So there we were. A group of students weaved together by chance trying to put together one of the most ambitious non-profits in recent history. We had everything to prove. In that week, GiveCard was born.</p>
